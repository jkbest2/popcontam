  abstract = {Log normal-like concentration distributions are ubiquitously observed in the environment. However, the mechanistic origins are not well understood. In this paper, we show that first order exponential kinetics onsets log-normal concentration distributions, under certain assumptions. Given the ubiquity of exponential kinetics, e.g., source and sink processes, this model suggests an explanation for the frequent observation in the environment, and elsewhere. We compare this model to other mechanisms affecting concentration distributions, e.g., source mixing. Finally, we discuss possible implications for data analysis and modelling, e.g., log-normal rates and fluxes.},

  abstract = {For more than a decade, numerous pesticides have been detected in river systems of the western United States that support anadromous species of Pacific salmon and steelhead. Over the same interval, several declining wild salmon populations have been listed as either threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Because pesticides occur in surface waters that provide critical habitat for ESA-listed stocks, they are an ongoing concern for salmon conservation and recovery throughout California and the Pacific Northwest. Because pesticide exposures are typically sublethal, a key question is whether toxicological effects at (or below) the scale of the individual animal ultimately reduce the productivity and recovery potential of wild populations. In this study we evaluate how the sublethal impacts of pesticides on physiology and behavior can reduce the somatic growth of juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and, by extension, subsequent sizedependent survival when animals migrate to the ocean and overwinter in their first year. Our analyses focused on the organophosphate and carbamate classes of insecticides. These neurotoxic chemicals have been widely detected in aquatic environments. They inhibit acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme in the salmon nervous system that regulates neurotransmittermediated signaling at synapses. Based on empirical data, we developed a model that explicitly links sublethal reductions in acetylcholinesterase activity to reductions in feeding behavior, food ration, growth, and size at migration. Individual size was then used to estimate sizedependent survival during migration and transition to the sea. Individual survival estimates were then integrated into a life-history population projection matrix and used to calculate population productivity and growth rate. Our results indicate that short-term (i.e., four-day) exposures that are representative of seasonal pesticide use may be sufficient to reduce the growth and size at ocean entry of juvenile chinook. The consequent reduction in individual survival over successive years reduces the intrinsic productivity (lambda) of a modeled oceantype chinook population. Overall, we show that exposures to common pesticides may place important constraints on the recovery of ESA-listed salmon species, and that simple models can be used to extrapolate toxicological impacts across several scales of biological complexity.

We quantified population-level effects of chronic contaminant exposure by coupling standard toxicity test data to matrix-type population models derived from long-term field studies of the Gulf of Mexico menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) and Chesapeake Bay striped bass (Morone saxatilis) populations. We used statistical regressions to quantify the uncertainty inherent in using test data ranging from life cycle tests to quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) to estimate effects of contaminants on the survival and reproduction parameters of the population models. We found that because of differences in life history, menhaden and striped bass differ in terms of their capacity to sustain the same level of contaminant-induced mortality. Changes in exploitation intensity affect the responses of both populations to the same level of additional contaminant-induced mortality. However, the quantitative effects of both factors are negligible compared to the uncertainty introduced by estimating long-term effects from short-term tests or QSARs. Our results suggest that consideration of life history may be important primarily for site-specific assessments. For screening-level assessments, the substantial differences in uncertainty associated with different types of test data are of much greater concern.},

  abstract = {To develop a habitat restoration strategy for the 8,270-km2 Skagit River basin, we estimated changes in smolt production of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch since European settlement began in the basin, based on changes in summer and winter rearing habitat areas. We assessed changes in coho salmon smolt production by habitat type and by cause of habitat alteration. We estimated that the coho salmon smolt production capacity of summer habitats in the Skagit River basin has been reduced from 1.28 million smolts to 0.98 million smolts (--24\%) and that the production capacity of winter habitats has been reduced from 1.77 million to 1.17 million smolts (--34\%). The largest proportion of summer non-main-stem habitat losses has occurred in side-channel sloughs (41\%), followed by losses in small tributaries (31\%) and distributary sloughs (29\%). The largest loss of winter habitats has occurred in side-channel sloughs (52\%), followed by losses in distributary sloughs (37\%) and small tributaries (11\%). By type of impact, hydromodification (diking, ditching, dredging) associated with agricultural and urban lands accounts for 73\% of summer habitat losses and 91\% of winter habitat losses. Blocking culverts on small tributaries account for 13\% of the decrease in summer habitat and 6\% of the decrease in winter habitat. Forestry activities account for 9\% of summer habitat losses and 3\% of winter habitat losses. Limitations of the analysis and implications for developing a habitat restoration strategy are discussed.},

  abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have left a legacy of environmental contamination. Even though they were banned from production and active use in the 1970s, they persist in the environment and still have the potential to impact aquatic life. Our objective was to identify data from controlled laboratory studies of PCB-related adverse effects in fish and to conduct a meta-analysis on mortality, growth, and reproductive (MGR) threshold responses. For each endpoint type, we compiled data on the lowest-observed-adverse effect concentration (LOAEC) and the degree of effect at the LOAEC as a percentage of control. The LOAECs were expressed as tissue concentrations, so the term lowest-observed-adverse-effect residue concentration (LOAER) was used to represent PCB exposures. The lower limit of applicability was set at 0.1 mg/g total PCB tissue concentration, below which adverse MGR effects in fish were not supported by the data. Sensitivity distributions identifying the probability of adverse effects in fish populations or communities predicted that 25\% of fish species would be impacted between 0.1 and 7.5 mg/g. Concentration--response threshold regressions were developed from the MGR datasets. For example, a 1 mg/g total PCB tissue concentration would predict effects of 17\% mortality, 15\% growth, and 39\% reproductive. The analysis determined the degree of adverse response, with uncertainty estimates, expected across a broad range of PCB tissue exposure concentrations in fish. Data generated from MGR endpoints were combined to determine an approach for overall effect thresholds for PCB-related injury in fish. The MGR datasets included only laboratory data; however, responses were compared with field-observed effects. The present review provides a comprehensive assessment of PCB-induced injury in fish utilizing a data-inclusive approach. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:712--736.

This choice impacts on future analyses from Environmental Specimen Bank samples. A number of advantages exist to support using either individual or pooled samples for temporal trend studies. However, it is important to know the total and analytical variance to be able to design the best sampling strategy. Statistical power in temporal or spatial studies is determined by the random/unexplained sample variation. The relationship between chemical analytical error and other sources of variation, as well as the cost for collection, preparation of samples and chemical analysis, will determine the number of individuals in each pool, and the number of pools that should be analysed to achieve high cost efficiency and good statistical power. Various scenarios of different numbers of individual samples, different numbers of pooled samples containing various numbers of individual specimens, the relationships between chemical analytical error and other sources of sample variance, have been compared by simulating random sampling from computer generated populations using realistic measures of variation from ongoing monitoring activities. These results offer guidance in the design of a cost-efficient, statistically sound sampling strategy.},

The environmental characterization is a reach-scale, monthly time step, species-neutral depiction of the stream that focuses on environmental features relevant to salmonids. The species-habitat rating rules are explicit assumptions about the relationship between the stream reach characterization and species-life stage survival. Life history trajectories are multiple computer-generated pathways through the environment. Finally, life history and population performance, defined by Beverton--Holt productivity and capacity parameters, is calculated for each life history trajectory and these trajectories are combined across spatial and biological scales to compute population performance.

I use simulation experiments to determine an optimum pooled-sample design as a function of the number of subpopulations and the number of available samples.

Characterizing the distributions of concentrations of environmental compounds or their metabolites in the US population is a primary objective of CDC's biomonitoring program. Historically, this characterization has been based on individual measurements of these compounds in body fluid or tissue from representative samples of the population. Pooling samples before making analytical measurements can reduce the costs of biomonitoring by reducing the number of analyses. For the first time in NHANES 2005--2006, a weighted pooled-sample design was implemented to facilitate pooling samples before making analytical measurements. This paper describes this design and the estimation method being developed in the National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences (NCEH/DLS) to characterize concentrations of polychlorinated and polybrominated compounds. We present percentile estimates for 2,2 {$\prime$} ,4,4 {$\prime$} ,5,5 {$\prime$} -hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB153) in specific subpopulations of the US based on the NHANES 2005--2006 pooled-sample design.

  abstract = {Biomonitoring for environmental chemicals presents various challenges due to the expense of measuring some compounds and the fact that in some samples the levels of many compounds may be below the limit of detection (LOD) of the measuring instrument. Even though various statistical methods have been developed to address issues associated with data being censored because results were below the LOD, the expense of measuring many compounds in large numbers of subjects remains a challenge. One solution to these challenges is to use pooled samples. There are many problems associated with the use of pooled samples as compared with individual samples, but using pooled samples can sometimes reduce the number of analytical measurements needed. Also, because pooled samples often have larger sample volumes, using pooled samples can result in lower LODs and thereby decrease the likelihood that results will be censored. However, many data sets obtained from environmental measurements have been shown to have a log-normal distribution, so using pooled samples presents a new problem: The measured value for a pooled sample is comparable to an arithmetic average of log-normal results and thus represents a biased estimate of the central tendency of the samples making up the pool. In this paper, we present a method for correcting the bias associated with using data from pooled samples with a log-normal distribution. We use simulation experiments to demonstrate how well the bias-correction method performs. We also present estimates for levels of PCB 153 and p,p{$\prime$}-DDE using data from pooled samples from the 2001 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys.},

In total, we examined scales from 2604 individuals from 5 stocks over 7 outmigration years characterized by a range of survival conditions (range from 0.11 to 9.50\%). We observed a positive relationship between growth during the first year at sea and survival for adults returning to Puget Sound and the Washington coast. Scale growth during the first year at sea did not co-vary between coastal Washington and Puget Sound stocks, and in most years coastal Chinook salmon attained a larger size at the end of the first year at sea. Large scale oceanographic variables (PDO, NPGO) were not significantly related to variation in scale growth, but for some Puget Sound populations, scale growth was higher in years of cooler sea surface temperatures and lower Pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) abundance. We developed a biological indicator for forecasting cohort survival of Tumwater Falls hatchery Chinook salmon on the Deschutes River, WA using marine growth estimates of the earliest returning fish (age-21). The marine growth index predicted survival better for 8 brood years compared to a recent 5 year average returns forecasting approach (3.40\% vs 35.41\% Mean Percent Error). Results from this study suggest that early marine growth is important to the survival of Puget Sound and coastal Washington Chinook salmon and may be a useful biological indicator to improve pre-season forecasting of Chinook salmon populations in Washington State.},

For each population, we evaluated climate impacts at all life stages and modeled future trajectories forced by global climate model projections. Populations rapidly declined in response to increasing sea surface temperatures and other factors across diverse model assumptions and climate scenarios. Strong density dependence limited the number of salmon that survived early life stages, suggesting a potentially efficacious target for conservation effort. Other solutions require a better understanding of the factors that limit survival at sea. We conclude that dramatic increases in smolt survival are needed to overcome the negative impacts of climate change for this threatened species.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic stressors, including chemical contamination and temperature stress, may contribute to increased disease susceptibility in aquatic animals. Specifically, the organophosphate pesticide malathion has been detected in surface waters inhabited by threatened and endangered salmon. In the presence of increasing water temperatures, malathion may increase susceptibility to disease and ultimately threaten salmon survival. This work examines the effect of acute and sublethal exposures to malathion on ocean-type subyearling Chinook salmon held under two temperature regimes. Chinook salmon were exposed to malathion at optimal (11{$^\circ$}C) or elevated (19 and 20{$^\circ$}C) temperatures. The influence of temperature on the acute toxicity of malathion was determined by generating 96-h lethal concentration (LC) curves. A disease challenge assay was also used to assess the effects of sublethal malathion exposure. The malathion concentration that resulted in 50\% mortality (LC50; 274.1{$\mu$}gL-1) of the Chinook salmon at 19{$^\circ$}C was significantly less than the LC50 at 11{$^\circ$}C (364.2{$\mu$}gL-1). Mortality increased 11.2\% in Chinook salmon exposed to malathion at the elevated temperature and challenged with Aeromonas salmonicida compared to fish held at the optimal temperature and exposed to malathion or the carrier control. No difference in disease challenge mortality was observed among malathion-exposed and unexposed fish at the optimal temperature. The interaction of co-occurring stressors may have a greater impact on salmon than if they occur in isolation. Ecological risk assessments considering the effects of an individual stressor on threatened and endangered salmon may underestimate risk when additional stressors are present in the environment.},

We used data from coded wire tag release groups of hatchery Chinook salmon to test whether hatchery release date, release size, and size in offshore waters in July and September influenced marine survival. Marine survival was most strongly related to the average body size in July, with larger sizes associated with higher survivals. This relationship was consistent over multiple years (1997--2002), suggesting that mortality after July is strongly size-dependent. Release size and date only slightly improved this relationship, whereas size in September showed little relationship to marine survival. Specifically, fish that experienced the highest marine survivals were released before 25 May and were larger than 17~g (or 120~mm fork length) by July. Our findings highlight the importance of local conditions in Puget Sound (Washington, USA) during the spring and summer, and suggest that declines in marine survival since the 1980s may have been caused by reductions in the quality of feeding and growing conditions during early marine life.},

  abstract = {In marine ecosystems, survival can be heavily influenced by size-selective mortality during juvenile life stages. Understanding how and when size-selective mortality operates on a population can reveal underlying growth dynamics and size-selective ecological processes affecting the population and thus can be used to guide conservation efforts. For subyearling Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in Puget Sound, previous research reported a strong positive relationship between marine survival and body mass during midsummer in epipelagic habitats within Puget Sound, suggesting that early marine growth drives survival. However, a fine-scale analysis of size-selective mortality is needed to identify specific critical growth periods and habitats. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe occupancy patterns across estuarine delta, nearshore marine, and offshore epipelagic habitats in Puget Sound; (2) describe changes in FL and weight observed across habitats and time; (3) evaluate evidence for size-selective mortality; and (4) illustrate how marine survival of the stocks studied may be affected by variation in July weight. In 2014 and 2015, we sampled FLs, weights, and scales from seven hatchery-origin and two natural-origin stocks of subyearling Chinook Salmon captured every 2 weeks during out-migration and rearing in estuary, nearshore, and offshore habitats within Puget Sound. Natural-origin stocks had more protracted habitat occupancy patterns than hatchery-origin stocks and were smaller than hatchery-origin stocks in both years. Regardless of origin, subyearlings were longer and heavier and grew faster in offshore habitats compared to estuary and nearshore habitats. For all stocks, we found little evidence of size-selective mortality among habitats in Puget Sound. These patterns were consistent in both years. Finally, the weights of subyearlings sampled during July in the offshore habitat predicted Puget Sound-wide marine survival rates of 0.4\% for 2014 and 2.0\% for 2015, with stock-specific predictions ranging from 0.18\% to 11.70\%.},

For Pacific salmon, including Chinook Salmon, brood year (BY) strength may be determined by size-selective processes that occur during early marine residence. However, the relative importance of freshwater versus marine growth in determining recruitment success is unknown. We conducted a scale-based retrospective analysis to examine the relative effects of freshwater and marine growth on survival to the age of reproduction for female Chinook Salmon by BY in the Taku (BYs 1979--1985, 1990--1999, 2002--2004) and Unuk (BYs 1981--1983, 1986--1988, 1994--2003, 2005--2006) rivers located in Southeast Alaska. First-year marine growth of Chinook Salmon was positively related to total return, productivity (returns per spawner), and marine survival for stocks from both systems. In the Taku River, growth during the third year at sea was positively related to marine survival. Annual growth of Taku River Chinook Salmon was correlated with previous growth through the second year at sea; however, no correlations were detected between adjacent growth zones of Unuk River fish. These findings suggest that current declines in Chinook Salmon abundance in Southeast Alaska is attributed to changes in growth conditions during the first year at sea.},

Using a Leslie matrix model for chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that specifies transitions among spawning nests (redds), streams, tidal deltas, nearshore habitats, and the ocean, we compared the relative importance of different habitats under three density-dependent scenarios: juvenile density independence, densitydependent mortality within streams, delta, and nearshore, and density-dependent migration among streams, delta, and nearshore. Each scenario assumed density dependence during spawning. We examined how these scenarios influenced priorities for habitat restoration using a set of hypothetical watersheds whose habitat areas could be systematically varied, as well as the Duwamish and Skagit rivers. In all watersheds, the three scenarios shared high sensitivity to changes in in nearshore and ocean mortality and produced similar responses to changes in other parameters controlling mortality (i.e., habitat quality). However, the three scenarios exhibited striking variation in population response to changes in habitat area (i.e., capacity). These findings indicate that nearshore habitat relationships may play significant roles for salmon populations and that the relative importance of restoring habitat area will depend on the mechanism of density dependence influencing salmon stocks.},

Evaluating population-level impacts of sublethal exposure concentrations is, however, complex and confounded by other environmental pressures. Applying effect measures derived from laboratory-based chemical exposures to impacts in wild fish populations is constrained by uncertainty on how biochemical response measures (biomarkers) translate into health outcomes, lack of available data for chronic exposures and the many uncertainties in available fish population models. Furthermore, wild fish show phenotypic plasticity and local adaptations can occur that adds geographic and temporal variance on responses. Such population-level factors are rarely considered in the chemical risk assessment process and can probably be derived only from studies on wild fish. Molecular technologies, including microsatellite and SNP genotyping, and RNASeq for gene expression studies, are advancing our understanding of mechanisms of eco-toxicological response, tolerance, adaptation and selection in wild populations. We examine critically the application of such approaches with examples including using microsatellites that has identified roach (Rutilus rutilus) populations living in rivers contaminated with sewage effluents that are self-sustaining, and studies of stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) that have identified genomic regions under selection putatively related to pollution tolerance. Integrating data on biological effects between laboratory-based studies and wild populations, and building understanding on adaptive responses to sublethal exposure are some of the priority research areas for more effective evaluation of population risks and resilience to contaminant exposure.},

  abstract = {An investigation into the causes of species decline should include examination of habitats important for multiple life stages. Integrating habitat impacts across life stages with life-cycle models (LCMs) can reveal habitat impairments inhibiting recovery and help guide restoration efforts. As part of the final elements of the Habitat Restoration Planning model (HARP; Beechie et al. this volume), we developed LCMs for four populations of three species of anadromous salmonids (Oncorhynchus kisutch, O. tshawytscha, and O. mykiss), and ran diagnostic scenarios to examine effects of barrier removal, fine sediment reduction, wood augmentation, riparian shade, restoration of the main channel and bank conditions, beaver pond restoration, and floodplain reconnection. In the wood scenario, spawner abundance for all populations increased moderately (29--48\%). In the shade scenario, spring-run Chinook salmon abundance increased the most (48\%) and fall-run Chinook salmon and steelhead were much less responsive. Coho responded strongly to the beaver pond and floodplain scenarios (76\% and 54\%, respectively). The fine sediment scenario most benefitted fall- and spring-run Chinook salmon (32--63\%), whereas steelhead and coho were less responsive (11--21\% increase). More observations are needed to understand high fine sediment and its impacts. Our LCMs were region-specific, identifying places where habitat actions had the highest potential effects. For example, the increase in spring-run Chinook salmon in the wood scenario was driven by the Cascade Mountains Ecological Region. And, although the overall response of coho salmon was small in the barrier removal scenario (6\% increase at the scale of the entire basin), barrier removals had important sub-regional impacts. The HARP analysis revealed basin-wide and regional population-specific potential benefits by action types, and this habitat-based approach could be used to develop restoration strategies and guide population rebuilding. An important next step will be to ground-truth our findings with robust empirically-based estimates of life stage-specific survivals and abundances.},

  abstract = {In some Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. populations, many adults die after reaching freshwater spawning sites but prior to spawning, a phenomenon known as prespawn mortality (PSM). Causal factors for PSM are often uncertain, but pathogens, warm water temperature, and environmental toxicants have been implicated in several studies. In this two-year project, we examined the relationship between toxicants and PSM in a threatened population of spring-run Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha (Walbaum) in the Willamette River, Oregon. Muscle and skin samples from 63 female carcasses were screened for {\textasciitilde}125 potential toxicants, including trace elements, pesticides, and organohalogens. Mean concentrations for five toxicants selected for their known adverse effects on salmonids were: 4.3 (SD\,=\,2.0) ng/g cadmium, 72.9 (122.7) ng/g nickel, 10.0 (9.0) ng/g lead, 12.7 (8.6) ng/g polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 17.6 (10.3) ng/g DDT (an organochlorine pesticide). Using generalized linear models, we found no statistical differences in toxicants concentrations between successful (n\,=\,37, 58.7\%) and unsuccessful (n\,=\,26, 41.3\%) female spawners. We conclude that selected contaminants did not provoke acute toxicity in Willamette River Chinook salmon. It remains unknown whether sub-lethal or chronic toxicant effects on adult salmon physiology or behavior have affected the fitness of this threatened population.},

The watersheds included the Nooksack and Skagit Rivers in the Northern Puget Sound, the Cedar River in the Seattle--Tacoma corridor, and the Yakima River, a tributary of the Columbia River. The Bayesian network relative risk model (BN-RRM) was used to conduct this ecological risk assessment and was modified to contain an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition pathway parameterized using data from CH toxicity data sets. The completed BN-RRM estimated risk at a population scale to Chinook salmon employing classical matrix modeling runs up to 50-y timeframes. There were 3 primary conclusions drawn from the model-building process and the risk calculations. First, the incorporation of an AChE inhibition pathway and the output from a population model can be combined with environmental factors in a quantitative fashion. Second, the probability of not meeting the management goal of no loss to the population ranges from 65\% to 85\%. Environmental conditions contributed to a larger proportion of the risk compared to CH. Third, the sensitivity analysis describing the influence of the variables on the predicted risk varied depending on seasonal conditions. In the summer, WT and DO were more influential than CH. In the winter, when the seasonal conditions are more benign, CH was the driver. Fourth, in order to reach the management goal, we calculated the conditions that would increase juvenile survival, adult survival, and a reduction in toxicological effects. The same process in this example should be applicable to the inclusion of multiple pesticides and to more descriptive population models such as those describing metapopulations.

We estimated acute and delayed mortality rates for seaward migrating juvenile Chinook salmon that feed and grow in a Superfund-designated area in the Lower Willamette River in Portland, Oregon. We combined previous, field-collected exposure data for juvenile Chinook salmon together with reduced growth and disease resistance data from earlier field and laboratory studies. Estimates of mortality were then incorporated into a life cycle model to explore chemical habitat-related fish loss. We found that 54\% improved juvenile survival---potentially as a result of future remediation activities---could increase adult Chinook salmon population abundance by more than 20\%. This study provides a framework for evaluating pollution remediation as a positive driver for species recovery.},

  month = jul,
  abstract = {Populations are often the endpoints of interest to managers in Ecological Risk Assessments (ERAs). However, many population-level ERAs do not integrate metapopulation dynamics, such as dispersal between locally adapted subpopulations, and thus preclude an understanding of how population viability is affected by toxicants and environmental stressors at a landscape scale. A stochastic matrix metapopulation model was developed using demographic data for three locally adapted spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) subpopulations and one hatchery subpopulation in the Yakima River Basin (YRB), WA. This model was simulated for 24 exposure scenarios, each with 200 simulations of a 50-year metapopulation projection. Subpopulation size outcomes from the simulations were incorporated as the endpoint of an ERA (Bayesian Network- Relative Risk Model, BN-RRM) that integrates the seasonal effects of organophosphate insecticides and environmental stressors (water temperature and dissolved oxygen) on Chinook salmon into a single probabilistic framework. Risk was defined as the probability that a subpopulation would decline from the initial abundance (500,000 individuals per subpopulation). Results of this ERA indicated that risk for wild spring Chinook subpopulations was higher (97\% for the American River and 74\% for the Naches Rive v subpopulation) than for non-wild subpopulations experiencing high dispersal with a local hatchery (30\% for both the hatchery and hatchery-supplemented subpopulations). A seasonal effect of stressors, driven primarily by high water temperatures in summer, was also detected where summer had the highest risk (68.7\%) and winter had the lowest risk (52\%). Environmental stressors made up a greater proportion of total risk in most scenarios than exposure to organophosphates. These results suggest that metapopulation spatial structure, local adaptation of conspecific populations, and seasonal differences in exposure to stressors impact the distribution of risk at the landscape scale. This method of using site-specific metapopulation model simulations as a probabilistic ERA endpoint shows promise for estimating the spatiotemporal impacts of stressors on Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed species at the metapopulation level, where metapopulation dynamics and spatial structure create complex risk dynamics.},

Risk was defined as the percent probability that the abundance of a subpopulation would decline from their initial abundance (500\,000). This definition of risk reflects the Puget Sound Partnership's management goal of achieving ``no net loss'' of Chinook abundance. The BN-RRM model results for projection year 20 showed that risk (in \% probability) from OPs and environmental stressors was higher for the wild subpopulations---the American River (50.9\%--97.7\%) and Naches (39.8\%--84.4\%) spring Chinook---than for the hatchery population (CESRF 18.5\%--46.5\%) and the Upper Yakima subpopulation (21.5\%--68.7\%). Metapopulation risk was higher in summer (58.1\%--68.7\%) than in winter (33.6\%--53.2\%), and this seasonal risk pattern was conserved at the subpopulation level. To reach the management goal in the American River spring Chinook subpopulation, the water temperature conditions in the Lower Yakima River would need to decrease. We demonstrate that 1) relative risk can vary across a metapopulation's spatial range, 2) dispersal among patches impacts subpopulation abundance and risk, and 3) local adaptation within a salmon metapopulation can profoundly impact subpopulation responses to equivalent stressors. Fine-scale risk estimates can be produced by integrating metapopulation model simulations into a Bayesian network relative risk model (BN-RMM). Risk differed across spring Chinook salmon subpopulations in the Yakima River Basin, Washington, USA, highlighting the importance of considering life history differences when making risk predictions for environmental stressors. Water temperature is the risk factor that requires management to prevent loss of Chinook population abundance, given our modeling efforts. Small sample sizes for organophosphate in winter introduced sufficient uncertainty to increase the influence of toxicological effects in winter.},

  abstract = {Life-cycle models combine several strengths for estimating population parameters and biological reference points of harvested species and are particularly useful for those exhibiting distinct habitat shifts and experiencing contrasting environments. Unfortunately, time series data are often limited to counts of adult abundance and harvest. By incorporating data from other populations and by dynamically linking the life-history stages, Bayesian life-cycle models can be used to estimate stagespecific productivities and capacities as well as abundance of breeders that produce maximum sustained yield (MSY). Using coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) as our case study, we show that incorporating information on marine survival variability from nearby populations can improve model estimates and affect management parameters such as escapement at MSY. We further show that the expected long-term average yield of a fishery managed for a spawner escapement target that produces MSY strongly depends on the average marine survival. Our results illustrate the usefulness of incorporating information from other sources and highlight the importance of accounting for variation in marine survival when making inferences about the management of Pacific salmon.},

We highlight widespread declines in Pacific salmon size based on 60 years of measurements from 12.5 million fish across Alaska, the last largely pristine North American salmon-producing region. Declines in salmon size, primarily resulting from shifting age structure, are associated with climate and competition at sea. Compared to salmon maturing before 1990, the reduced size of adult salmon after 2010 has potentially resulted in substantial losses to ecosystems and people; for Chinook salmon we estimated average per-fish reductions in egg production (-16\%), nutrient transport (-28\%), fisheries value (-21\%), and meals for rural people (-26\%). Downsizing of organisms is a global concern, and current trends may pose substantial risks for nature and people.},

That is, when the logarithms of the observed concentrations are plotted as a frequency distribution, the resulting distribution is approximately normal, or Gaussian, over much of the observed range. Examples include radionuclides in soil, pollutants in ambient air, indoor air quality, trace metals in streams, metals in biological tissue, calcium in human remains. The ubiquity of the lognormal distribution in environmental processes is surprising and has not been adequately explained, since common processes in nature (for example, computation of the mean and the analysis of error) usually give rise to distributions that are normal rather than lognormal. This paper takes the first step toward explaining why lognormal distributions can arise naturally from certain physical processes that are analogous to those found in the environment. In this paper, these processes are treated mathematically, and the results are illustrated in a laboratory beaker experiment that is simulated on the computer.},

One of the products of the Exxon Valdez oil spill was the first report of damage to eggs and larvae of pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) following long-term exposure to low concentrations of weathered crude oil. These life stages were previously thought to be highly resistant to injury from oil. Growth rate among migrating fry was depressed, and the population was reduced via size-dependent mortality. Elevated egg mortality in oiled streams continued for at least 4 years after the spill. Laboratory tests verified that embryos are sensitive to long-term exposure to weathered oil in the low parts per billion range. These results are compared with those of studies conducted by investigators funded by Exxon Corporation and, where controversy exists, we attempt to reconcile the studies. These findings are important to the pink salmon fisheries of Prince William Sound (PWS) and are also broadly applicable to toxicity and impact from nonpoint source pollution of urban estuaries.},

  abstract = {The control of point-source contaminants and regulations designed for specific waste discharges have reduced incidents of fish kills. These actions, however, do not protect fish like salmon, which encounter many different contaminants during extensive migrations. Attempts to document pollutant-associated toxicity is challenging in migratory salmon, although a few laboratory and field studies have produced a convincing body of evidence that lifelong contaminant exposure can contribute to the demise of fish. The case of the decline of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in British Columbia, Canada, brought into sharp relief the difficulty of assigning a specific cause (e.g., climate, disease, or contaminants) to a diffuse problem (i.e., low fish returns). Determining the effects that pollutants have on wild salmon requires study designs that consider life history, habitat, and the real world of complex contaminant exposures. In the absence of evidence from such study designs, the future survival of salmon may hinge on the application by managers of the precautionary approach to stressors that are within immediate jurisdictional control, such as toxic chemicals.},

Chronic effects of immune suppression, reproductive impairment, and growth reduction were examined using life history models for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Modeled immune suppression acted through reductions in age-specific survival, with first- and secondyear survival producing the greatest changes in the population growth rate ({$\lambda$}). A 10\% reduction in various reproductive parameters all produced a similar {$\lambda$}, but different sensitivity and stable age distributions. Growth reduction models incorporated effects to both survival and reproduction and produced additive effects. Overall, model output indicated that for Chinook salmon, alteration of first-year survival has the greatest relative impact on {$\lambda$}. Results support the importance of linking toxicity endpoints to the demographic traits that they influence and help generate toxicity tests that are more relevant for the species.

  abstract = {Standard laboratory toxicity tests assess the physiological responses of individual organisms to exposure to toxic substances under controlled conditions. Time and space restrictions often prevent the assessment of population-level responses to a toxic substance. Contaminants can affect various biological functions (e.g. growth, fecundity or behavior), which may alter different demographic traits, leading to population-level impacts. In this study, immune suppression, reproductive dysfunction and somatic growth impairment were examined using life history matrix models for coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Our intent was to gauge the relative magnitude of response to toxic effects among species and between life history stages, not provide a specific estimate of population growth rate or abundance. Effects due to immune suppression were modeled as reductions in age-specific survival. Toxic impacts on reproductive function were modeled as a 10\% reduction in reproductive contribution for all reproductively mature age groups. Model runs that examined the effect of somatic growth reduction on population parameters incorporated both survival and reproductive impacts. All impacts were modeled as 10\% reductions in the affected population demographic parameters. First-year survival and reproductive impacts produced similar population growth rates ({$\lambda$}), but resulted in different sensitivity and stable age distributions. Modeled somatic growth reduction produced additive effects on survival and reproduction. Toxic stressors producing similar changes in {$\lambda$} did not necessarily produce similar changes in the age distributions. Sensitivity and elasticity analyses demonstrated that changes to the first-year survival rate produced the greatest per-unit effect on {$\lambda$} for each species. Alteration in abundance of mature females also strongly influenced {$\lambda$}. Differences observed between species showed that the number of reproductive ages and time to reproductive maturity were important components for population-level responses. These results emphasize the importance of linking toxicity responses at low concentrations to the demographic traits they affect, and help to highlight the toxicity tests that are more suitable for assessing impacts on the focal species. Additionally, life history modeling is a useful tool for developing testable hypotheses regarding impacts on specific populations as well as for conducting comparisons between populations.},

Survival of naturally produced fry, most of which leave Glenariffe Stream within 24 h of emergence, averaged 0.079\% (range 0.013-1.17\%). For hatchery fish released at 8-12 months, standardised to a mean weight of 38 g, survival covaried with weight at release consistently across all brood years and averaged 0.34\% (range 0.008-3.28\%). Survival rates for hatchery fish were four times higher than for naturally produced fry, but were extremely poor relative to their size at release. Survival rates for fish of natural and hatchery origin were positively correlated, suggesting that recruitment of both stocks is primarily controlled by common influences within the marine environment, probably during the first winter at sea. Stock-recruitment analysis for the natural population showed little tendency for recruitment to increase with stock size, suggesting that marine survival rates may be density dependent. Although the reasons for the relatively poor survival of hatchery fish are unclear, the results provide a case study in which hatchery fish appear to have a poorer ``fitness to survive'' than their natural counterparts.}

  abstract = {In the last few years, the interest in using ecological population models as a tool for pesticide risk assessment has increased rapidly. Practical guidance, however, on how to perform a risk assessment with a population model is still lacking. It is still unclear which endpoint (population density, population growth, etc.) is the most sensitive indicator of population-level effects and how risk can be evaluated at the population level. Moreover, a main added value of model-based risk assessments, which is an understanding of the mechanisms involved in alternative exposure scenarios, so far has received little attention. We therefore used an example model to compare commonly used endpoints and alternative exposure scenarios. The model is a structurally realistic, but relatively simple, individual-based, spatially explicit model for the common shrew (Sorex araneus), which was selected because it has been tested and validated extensively. We show that population density is more sensitive for detecting population-level effects in the short term (months) than population growth rate. Population viability measured by extinction risk can also be a relevant endpoint, because it is especially sensitive for small populations. We show that landscape structure and the timing of pesticide application (population structure at the time of application) can have a great impact on population recovery, and we analyze statistical tests for use in population-level risk assessments. Our results demonstrate which factors and insights should be taken into account in population-level risk assessments. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:1292--1300. {\copyright} 2010 SETAC},

We analyzed a data set of more than 54 000 juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from 15 populations over five years. The juveniles were tagged during the summer in their freshwater rearing habitats and then recaptured at downstream sites the following spring after an extended rearing and overwintering period. We measured the length and weight of fish at tagging and computed a ``condition index'' that determined how fat or thin a fish was relative to others. Among populations, mean length and mean condition index were poor predictors of survival, but we did detect year and site effects. Within populations, survival was strongly related to the relative length of individuals but not to relative condition index. Our results are consistent with length-related mechanisms of mortality mediated by hierarchical behavior, and thus merely measuring changes in mean values of morphological traits in populations of juveniles may provide little insight into expected changes in population viability. Expanding upon these results, we predicted a nearly 60\% increase in selection for juvenile fish length when we extended our observation period through adulthood. Thus, monitoring populations through only a portion of their life history may present an incomplete picture of their survival variability.},
